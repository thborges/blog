I'm a professor at a Brazilian university called UFJ (Former Jata√≠ Regional, UFG, GO, Brazil). My research is focused in distributed spatial data processing, computer science algorithms and compilers. I do eletronics and 3d printing as hobbies. Recently, I'm involved in the creation of a fablab at the university.

You can find some of my code, tutorials and projects in my profiles at these sites:
